    <h2>Canadian Net Neutrality is endangered</h2>
    <p class="meta">23 April 2014</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/read/the-fcc-wants-to-end-net-neutrality?utm_source=motherboardfb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOTHERBOARD has reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, yesterday the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair &ldquo;will propose new regulations that would let internet service providers (ISPs) charge higher rates for higher-speed delivery of certain types of content, such as online video.&rdquo; This is very troubling news for internet users in the US and around the world. In an email, digital policy expert Prof. Michael Geist didn&rsquo;t mince words: &ldquo;If the </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/technology/fcc-new-net-neutrality-rules.html?hp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are true</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the FCC is [vaguely] </span><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/23/5645984/fcc-chairman-says-reports-of-net-neutralitys-death-are-flat-out-wrong"><span style="font-weight: 400;">denying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it tonight</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it guts </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">net neutrality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the United States.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up here in Canada, we&rsquo;re accustomed to smugly dismissing some of the worst parts of US politics. Take health care, for example. Even as Obamacare ramps up, millions of people still go without private health insurance in America. Those who can afford it get pretty great service, and those who can&rsquo;t are left with a hodgepodge of scraps and charity, effectively creating a two-tier system. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t happen here,&rdquo; we think, as we make social calls to our government-funded doctors. We&rsquo;re mostly isolated from this kind of thing spilling over.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so with the internet, especially in a country so economically and socially integrated with the our southern neighbors. Veteran tech journalist </span><a href="http://wordsbynowak.com/2014/04/24/fcc-netflix/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Nowak</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told me via email that because most large internet companies are located in the US, the &ldquo;huge can of worms&rdquo; that the FCC just opened &ldquo;pretty much applies to the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Canadians, much of our everyday internet traffic already passes through US servers, peering, and content delivery networks. If the FCC lets big players like ISPs &lsquo;offer&rsquo; a fast lane to effectively extort content providers like Netflix, it&rsquo;s likely that lots of Canadian web traffic could risk getting caught in the slow lane. As Geist explains, there isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;practical difference between deliberately slowing some traffic and deliberately speeding up other traffic.&nbsp; The end result is a two-tier Internet based on payments from content owners that can afford it.&nbsp; That strikes at the heart of net neutrality.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadian content owners and web businesses may end up having to pay American ISPs just to have their products compete on an even footing. Of course, this punishes small and startup businesses, who might not be able to afford this carriage fee to access the US market at a reasonable speed. Canadian consumers with or without cable TV connections, for their part, may just have to get very familiar with the animated loading icons of their favourite video sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if we keep our fingers crossed and none of the above happens, there&rsquo;s still a threat here. Nowak is concerned with the precedent the FCC rules may have for Canadian net neutrality: &ldquo;Sure, we have net neutrality rules here in Canada but if you don't think our big ISPs are going to be emboldened now to circumvent them or try to re-open the conversation, well then you don't know them very well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&rsquo;s got a point. Canada&rsquo;s major ISPs aren&rsquo;t exactly known for their low prices or competitive zeal. They&rsquo;re also huge content broadcasters and license-owners, which gives them the biggest reason in the world to try to take a run at net neutrality: profit. By stifling competition from the big wide fun internet, they get to keep their walled gardens intact and shareholders happy. Bandwidth caps are a prime example of this; many experts have argued that the ISPs claims about congestion don&rsquo;t add up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the caps are simply a way to &lsquo;take their cut&rsquo; of a service like Netflix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowak&rsquo;s assertion is also underscored by a recent complaint lodged with Canada&rsquo;s telecom regulator. Multi-headed internet/cable/phone/TV/media/newspaper company Bell has already been accused of unfair shenanigans on their wireless internet plans, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/11/26/bell-mobility-net-neutrality_n_4338654.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charging up to 800% more money for competing non-Bell content</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the FCC rules go through as reported, it&rsquo;s a safe bet that Canadian telecoms will be asking for &lsquo;regulatory harmonization&rsquo; and other innocuous-sounding econospeak that gets used when trying to soften protections of the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canadian government&rsquo;s recent digital strategy made </span><a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/canadas-internet-sucks-and-the-government-has-no-real-plan-to-improve-it"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no mention of protecting net neutrality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so we might not expect them to have our back on this anytime soon. Where does hope remain? Barack Obama </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">did</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make a </span><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/obama-pledges-net-neutrality-laws-if-elected-president/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign promise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to protect net neutrality, so there&rsquo;s a chance he could tell his </span><a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/ex-cable-and-wireless-lobbyist-confirmed-as-fcc-chairman/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ex-cable lobbyist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FCC chairman to back off for fear of an internet revolt. Another potential upside is that community networks and ISPs could get a boost. Instead of getting our internet from a private player, it&rsquo;s conceivable that enough of us could hop onto municipal networks offering equal access. This could shift the balance back in favour of neutrality, but it&rsquo;s admittedly a long shot. For now, it seems like Canadian internet users may have to gear up for a complicated fight on both sides of the border. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
