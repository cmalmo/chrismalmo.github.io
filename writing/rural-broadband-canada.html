    <h2>Rural Broadband in Canada Is Still a Mess</h2>
    <p class="meta">16 October 2014</p>

<p>The Canadian government just&nbsp;<a href="http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=892929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced the next step in its Digital Canada 150 plan</a>&nbsp;to bring &ldquo;high-speed internet to an additional 280,000 homes&rdquo; in mostly rural area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To those of us not living in the more densely populated southern and urban areas of Canada, this news should come as a relief. Unfortunately,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/canadas-internet-sucks-and-the-government-has-no-real-plan-to-improve-it">that plan still&nbsp;complicates the issue of rural broadband access</a>.</p>
<p>As the country argues about whether or not&nbsp;<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/canada-is-ignoring-netflix-and-google-during-broadcast-reform-hearings">Netflix will kill Canadian broadcasting</a>&nbsp;as we know it, most&nbsp;rural Canadians are still&nbsp;on dial-up and satellite connections and&nbsp;just want fast enough internet to reliably stream online video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it stands,&nbsp;Canada is already&nbsp;<a href="http://alphabeatic.com/akamai-broadband/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falling behind the world</a>&nbsp;in terms of broadband speeds and access, so it&rsquo;s laudable that the government is trying to do something to increase broadband availability to people in remote areas. It&rsquo;s a big country, after all.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/028.nsf/vwapj/Detailed_Maps_Ontario.zip/%24FILE/Detailed_Maps_Ontario.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ontario</a>, for example, contained an estimated 93,947 &ldquo;underserved&rdquo; households as defined by Industry Canada and the CRTC.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/028.nsf/vwapj/Detailed_Maps_Nunavut.zip/%24FILE/Detailed_Maps_Nunavut.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nunavut</a>, for its part, was entirely underserved with 8661 out of 8661 households lacking access to decent broadband.</p>
<p class="article__pull-quote">As it stands, Canada is already falling behind the world in terms of broadband speeds&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the Digital 150 plan works: Internet service providers (ISPs) will locate target areas of underserved households they wish to provide service to, apply for grants, and (hopefully) provide the service.&nbsp;Despite the government&rsquo;s good intentions, it&rsquo;s difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<p>First off,&nbsp;5 Mbps (the average internet connection speed in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/soti-visualizations.html#stoi-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kazakhstan</a>) is just enough to watch a decent Netflix stream without doing much else on your home internet connection (15 Mbps is the&nbsp;<a href="http://alphabeatic.com/akamai-broadband/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minimum</a>&nbsp;for 4k-resolution content). By no means is it enough for modern, connected life, or for a household that wants to cut the cable cord and still take in some video content.</p>
<p>Secondly, Canadian telecoms have a habit of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/policymonitoring/2013/cmr7.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under-delivering</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.piac.ca/files/piac_transparency_broadband_ads_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advertised broadband speeds</a>, cherry-picking data to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/telus-speed-claims-not-based-on-real-world-experience-1.2798029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argue against increased competition</a>, and other questionable moves.&nbsp;The amount of government money involved is no laughing matter, either. The last round of public dollars given to telecom companies to expand rural broadband was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2014/lt140605.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$421.9 million</a>&nbsp;in total, with mixed results to show for it.</p>
<p>Noted Canadian&nbsp;digital issues expert and academic&nbsp;<a href="http://michaelgeist.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Geist</a>&nbsp;put it best&nbsp;in an email to me, &ldquo;I found the [Digital Canada 150] strategy underwhelming and unambitious. I still do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One way to improve the performance of rural broadband would be for&nbsp;the government to&nbsp;challenge telecoms to offer a higher minimum level of service than 5 Mbps. After all, rural and northern Canadians deserve access to quality, world-standard internet connections as much as any urban yuppie. That being said, given the remoteness of some these rural locations, infrastructure needs to be considered by all parties.</p>
<p>What to do? Admittedly, the problem of rural broadband isn&rsquo;t easy. But the government&rsquo;s faith that the private sector will do the job with enough subsidies may not be the answer, because it hasn&rsquo;t really worked so far. As one Nobel Prize-winning economist will tell you, giant telecom firms with little competition are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-14/nobel-winning-message-for-the-fcc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking-profits</a>, not purely&nbsp;benevolent public services.</p>
<p>The government could try a few things. First, it could offer attractive financing or grants for community-owned broadband, which has been quietly creating success after success in North America, including in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/small-alberta-town-gets-massive-1-000-mbps-broadband-boost-1.1382428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olds, Alberta</a>&nbsp;which has affordable gigabit (1000 Mbps) internet to rural citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada could also&nbsp;experiment with a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/10/07/how-come-my-isp-wont-increase-internet-speed-and-l.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swedish strategy</a>&nbsp;of rolling out a patchwork of government-owned fiber networks, connecting them, and then competitively leasing access to third-party resellers&mdash;delivering faster speeds and lower prices.</p>
<p>Instead of trying something new, the government&rsquo;s strategy for rural and northern internet is poised to stick to a model that&rsquo;s produced middling results. It might be high time to change all that,&nbsp;and finally&nbsp;get Netflix streaming&nbsp;comfortably in the Arctic.</p><p><a href="/">← Back to all writing</a></p>
